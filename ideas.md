## New Data + Registry
* Only combos should handle data gen
* A combo should serve to simplify the registration of multiple similar blocks
* A combo should handle ALL data generation so that they can be declared and used with ease

* Explicit functions should be declared in cases that don't need a combo but still need data generation
